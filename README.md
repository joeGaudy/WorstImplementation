Read me for worst implementation.
THIS FILE IS A JOKE!
In theses files we have made two classes, a pay and Employee class. The Employee class will contain the name, hours worked, hourly money wage, type of employee, and belong to an arryay of Employees. 
In the pay class we have made a pay_array that will contain each employees earned payroll and will be indexed to each employee. This algorithm will take T(n) = THETA(n) time.
